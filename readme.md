# Artisan ML

## Goal

Code Machine Learning models to better understand them and improve my programming skills.

## Why

The sole purpose of this repository is for me to apply my theoretical learnings from different online resources, like DeepLearning.ai's Coursera courses. Online you can find many libraries with ready-to-use modeling techniques. Libraries such as Scikit, Tensorflow, and Pytorch are very well-known in the field given their accessibility. Yet, using these libraries does not necessarily mean you understand what is happening under the hood. It is important to understand the theory behind these libraries since during application modifications might be needed.

## Current progress:

Available, you can find a class that allows you to use Regression to predict. Both linear and logistic regression can be applied, and the models can also be tuned using Gradient Descent.
